# Zuplo Todo Sample

This is a simple [Zuplo](https://zuplo.com) sample Todo list API.

### Fork this repositoy

[Fork](https://github.com/zuplo/money-api-example/fork) the repository as you will need to connect Zuplo to your own repository.

### Step 1 - Deploy the web-app to Vercel

The web-app is an example used to create a portal where users can sign up and subscribe to your API.

> The deployment will not work until all the steps in this guide are completed but you will get the deployment URL which is needed in the next steps

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzuplo%2Fmoney-api-example%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fdashboard&project-name=money-api&demo-title=Money%20API&demo-description=Monetize%20your%20APIs%20in%2010%20minutes.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fmoney-api.zuplo.com)

### Step 2 - Setup web-app login with Auth0

Auth0 is used to enable authentication _for the web-app only_ using social providers like Google, or email/password. This is to secure users that are logging into the website and **not** to the API. For the API, your users will be able to issue an API Key using the Developer Portal created with Zuplo.

Steps:

1. Create and account and log-in in Autho [https://auth0.com](https://auth0.com)

2. Create an Application

![Create Auth0 App](./assets/auth0-create-account.png)

3. In the _Settings_ tab, update the _Allowed Callback URLs_ field. You'll add the domains that your app authentication will work with, using comma separated values:

![Set up Allowed Callback URL](./assets/auth0-allowed-callback-url.png)

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/auth0, https://$MY_APP_DOMAIN/api/auth/callback/auth0
```

4. Copy the environment values you'll use in your APP

![Copy Credentials values from Settings](./assets/auth0-credential-values.png)

Your env file will look like this:

```
# .env file
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://dev-ci7vajyawp0svo51.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=RXnCGWrH2Pl5REDACTED
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=REDACTED
```

### Step 3 - Create a Stripe Subscription Product

Stripe is used to manage the subscription of your users to your API. In this section, you will create a Stripe subscription product to allow your users to "pay as they go" and bill them for the exact number of requests that they made in a period of time.

Steps:

1. Log in to Stripe https://stripe.com (if you're creating a new account, you can skip the section of _Activate payments on your account_)

2. Create a subscription Product

![Stripe Add Product Step 1](./assets/stripe-add-product.png)

![Stripe Add Product Step 2](./assets/stripe-add-product-step-2.png)

3. Create a Pricing Table to embed on the web-app

Go back to _Product_ page.

![](./assets/stripe-add-pricing-table-2.png)

Make sure to set the checkout redirect to the deployed web-app domain:

4. Add the Pricing table to your website

Copy the Pricing Table and paste in [`/dashboard/components/stripe-pricing-table.tsx`](./dashboard/components/stripe-pricing-table.tsx)

![](./assets/stripe-add-pricing-table-4.png)

```diff
<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
-        YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TABLE HERE
+        <script async src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js"></script>
+        <stripe-pricing-table pricing-table-id="prctbl_1234ABC" publishable-key="pk_test_1234ABC">
+        </stripe-pricing-table>
      `,
  }}
/>
```

5. Save your Stripe Secret Key

![](./assets/stripe-get-secret-key.png)

```
# .env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk...
```

### Step 4 - Add an API Gateway to your API with Zuplo

The project you just forked contains configuration for the Zuplo API Gateway.

You can find the OpenAPI definition for a ToDo API under `config/routes.oas.json` which will be used by Zuplo to create the documentation of your API and also configure the routes to set-up API Key authentication and custom code to allow for monetizing your API directly from your API Gateway.

Under `/modules/monetization` you'll find a custom Zuplo Policy that we wrote which receives a requests and triggers user billing with Stripe.

The backend for this app can live anywhere and be written in any language, but in this example for simplicity we've used https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

Steps:

1. Create an account with Zuplo: http://zuplo.com

2. Create a Zuplo project from the template that you just forked

![Create Project in Zuplo](./assets/zuplo-create-project.png)

3. Copy the Zuplo Gateway URL

This is the URL that you'll use to make requests to your API.

![Copy Zuplo Gateway URL](./assets/zuplo-copy-gateway-url.png)

```
# .env
ZUPLO_GATEWAY_URL=https://money-api-example-main-53ecc01.zuplo.app
```

4. Copy the Zuplo Account ID and Project ID

<div style="display: flex">
  <img src="./assets/zuplo-account-id.png" />
  <img src="./assets/zuplo-project-id.png" />
</div>

```
# .env
ZUPLO_ACCOUNT_ID=plum_everyday_squirrel
ZUPLO_PROJECT_ID=teal-hornet
```

5. Create your credentials with Zuplo's Developer API

You can find this in your Accounts Settings page in Zuplo.

![](./assets/zuplo-create-dev-api-api-key.png)

```
# .env
ZUPLO_API_KEY=zpka_...
```

6. Get the Zuplo API Bucket name

Run in your terminal to fetch the name of the API Bucket that you'll use to create API Keys for your users.

```sh
export ZUPLO_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
export ZUPLO_API_KEY=zpka_ABC123

curl -s -X GET "https://dev.zuplo.com/v1/accounts/$ZUPLO_ACCOUNT_ID/key-buckets" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZUPLO_API_KEY" | jq ".data[1].name"

"zprj-123ABC-production"
```

```
# .env
ZUPLO_KEY_BUCKET=zprj-123ABC-production
```

## Step 5 - Update the Environment Variables of your Web-App

Now that you have all the environment variables of your account, you can update the environment variables in Vercel to make your web-app work.
